This application acts as a server room temperature guage.
It will read in the temperature via DHT11 Temperature guage
The server will need to run a python program that will listen via multicast to the application.
The server will turn on/off based on the temperature message sent via multicast.
I created a GUI for the raspi to be attached via a touch screen.
This is a great project for a small server room in your house.
